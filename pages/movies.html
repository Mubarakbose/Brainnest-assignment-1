            <p>
                Three idiots is a commedy movie by bollywood. It was all about three students 
                in an engineering institute. The 3 students became friends, 2 of them are studying 
                engineering out of their own will and the other one is talented, he plays a lot 
                but also the best while the other two study a lot but ended up with lowest 
                performance. Many lessons can be learned in the movie and this helps me reflect back to
                my life and the best part of the movie is that it's very funny.

                Home alone is one of the most popular movie because it is always played during 
                chrismass period on TV channels. As i child, i love watching the movie and even 
                today i never get tired of watching it. It was all about a clever little boy, who was 
                Traveling for chrismass break with his parents. And the boy accidentally ended up 
                on the wrong flight. He lived his chrismass days alone in a Hotel and later on 
                he moved to big house at New York City where he continue to face threats from 
                two buglers who wanted to steal from him. As a result the 
                clever boy made them sufer in funny way and called the police to arrest the buglers.
